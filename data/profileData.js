  bio: `
    > INITIATING BIO-SCAN...
    > SUBJECT IDENTIFIED.

    I am an AI Engineer obsessed with the intersection of scalable systems and generative intelligence. 
    Currently architecting next-gen memory systems at Harman DTS. 
    
    My mission is to build software that feels alive—bridging the gap between 
    rigid algorithms and fluid human intent.
    
    Whether it's coding out an end-to-end scalable AI-enabled SaaS
    or fine-tuning an LLM or training a Neural Network for industrial applications, 
    I wish to operate at the bleeding edge of what's possible.
